# Android-Composite-Builds-Example
Gradle 3.3 added support for composite builds. These are my examples of Android Studio Projects and using composite builds.

# Update:
## 11-25-2017

After updating to Android Studio 3.0.0 I have re-tested my example app and with some tweaks I am noticing that composite builds are now working. Will update this repo more as I fill out more example data

NOTE: This feature doesn't seem to work yet so for the time being this repo will be used to help track the bug
